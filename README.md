## Major projects

### 2019 BCN Re-architecture
The BBC's contribution network had grown slowly since 2012, but after some embarrassing on air issues and a change in management, a colleague and I were giving limited funding and support to transform it into a reliable platform that could take an essential core part of the BBCs IP strategy which could be trusted to deliver the output for major events such as [The funeral of Elizabeth II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_and_state_funeral_of_Elizabeth_II) and [Coronation of Charles III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation_of_Charles_III_and_Camilla), as well as normal events such as [Glastonbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glastonbury_Festival), [Reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_and_Leeds_Festivals) and key remote-production events like [Springwatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springwatch). 

### 2015 BBC Singapore Move
In 2015 the BBC moved its Asia Business operation to a new studio

Lead on the technical design and implementation of a major new international bureau for the BBC

Specification and Implementation of
    - Resilient IP Video network supporting a variety of broadcast codecs
    - On set and lower third graphics using Caspar CG
    - In house product (Raven) to power on-set video wall and gallery playouts
    - Video archive expansion

### 2011-2013 International video contribution
Design and install the BBC's international bureau IP video contribution network, utilising NTT encoders to broadcast via low cost internet connections from approximately 20 countries on 5 continents, including the 2014 US Midterm elections.
    - Design of operational control system to allow encoders to feed into hubs in London and Singapore
    - Design of bespoke monitoring system to identify network problems and route around them
    - Installation of encoders and self-op studios in a variety of locations from Gaza to Bangkok

### 2010-2014 JFE
JFE is in house software for exchanging video with BBC journalists in the field. It allows them to access the BBC's production systems across approximately 20 sites and file back packages from anywhere in the world. JFE puts approximately half of the typical BBC News bulletin on air, and allows high quality HD to be fed back in short order thanks to a combination of FFMPEG video compression and deep integration into News workflows and production systems. JFE was developed in a responsive way in collaboration with field shoot-edits to meet real business needs. Still in daily use in 2023 with little extra development.

### 2008 BBC News standard Linux build
Built an engineer-friendly version of Ubuntu to allow BBC News and elsewhere in the organisation to standardise our Linux estate. The build is active on about 900 machines across the organisation, replacing a small selection of Redhat, Suse, Solaris and Mandrake machines, and allowing the organisation to draw on great efficiencies in its server infrastructure.

Still in daily use in 2023 with very little extra development
